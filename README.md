# Dynamic NFT (dNFT) Framework

**Mission:** **Future Growth Product / Strategic Initiative.** A developer framework and suite of smart contracts for creating NFTs with mutable metadata, evolving traits, and on-chain interactivity. We enable new utility for digital collectibles, gaming, and brand engagement.

**Stage:** **Research & Development – Awaiting Resource Allocation**

## 🎯 PHASE 1 EXECUTION: CLARITY & SCOPE
**This repository is a strategic R&D project for future market expansion.**
-   **Owner:** *[RickCreator87]* | **Dependencies:** *Follows primary driver roadmap*
-   **Target Prototype:** *[Set Date: e.g., After KYC SDK MVP Launch]*

### Immediate Actions (This Week):
-   [ ] **Define Prototype Scope:** Document 1-2 core dynamic NFT "behaviors" to build (e.g., time-based evolution, oracle-triggered change).
-   [ ] **Create GitHub Project Board:** Link it here: `[Link to Project Board]`. Scope Epics: `Market Research`, `Architecture Design`, `Proof-of-Contract`.
-   [ ] **Establish Basic CI:** Implement pipeline for Solidity/Rust linting and contract compilation tests.

### 📁 Repository Structure & Purpose
-   `/contracts/` – **Future Product Core:** Reusable smart contract modules for different dynamic behaviors.
-   `/examples/` – **Developer Adoption Key:** Example implementations (e.g., an evolving artwork NFT, a game character NFT).
-   `/docs/` – **Product Foundation:** Technical specifications and white papers.

**Strategic Link:** This project's timeline and resource allocation are guided by the success of the primary revenue driver. The overall strategy is in: [gitdigital-products.io](https://github.com/Gitdigital-products/gitdigital-products.io).
